        "description": "Before getting started with Bootstrap’s modal component, be sure to read the following as our menu options have recently changed.\n\nModals are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the <body> so that modal content scrolls instead.\nClicking on the modal “backdrop” will automatically close the modal.\nBootstrap only supports one modal window at a time. Nested modals aren’t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences.\nModals use position: fixed, which can sometimes be a bit particular about its rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements. You’ll likely run into issues when nesting a .modal within another fixed element.\nOnce again, due to position: fixed, there are some caveats with using modals on mobile devices. See our browser support docs for details.\nDue to how HTML5 defines its semantics, the autofocus HTML attribute has no effect in Bootstrap modals. To achieve the same effect, use some custom JavaScript:",
