They can replace the text inside an element or be added as a modifier class to an existing component.\n\nWe apply additional styling to .btns via ::before to ensure the height is respected. You may extend this pattern for other situations as needed, or add a &nbsp; within the element to reflect the height when actual text is rendered in its place.",
