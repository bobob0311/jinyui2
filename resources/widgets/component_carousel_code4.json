While carousels support previous\/next controls and indicators, they’re not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit.\n\nYou must add the .active class to one of the slides, otherwise the carousel will not be visible. Also be sure to set a unique id on the .carousel for optional controls, especially if you’re using multiple carousels on a single page. Control and indicator elements must have a data-bs-target attribute (or href for links) that matches the id of the .carousel element.",
