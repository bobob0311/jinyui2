Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?

Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.<\/p>\n<\/div>",
