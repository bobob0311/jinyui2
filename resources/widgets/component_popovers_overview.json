        "description": "Things to know when using the popover plugin:\n\nPopovers rely on the third party library Popper for positioning. You must include popper.min.js before bootstrap.js, or use one bootstrap.bundle.min.js which contains Popper.\nPopovers require the popover plugin as a dependency.\nPopovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.\nZero-length title and content values will never show a popover.\nSpecify container: 'body' to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).\nTriggering popovers on hidden elements will not work.\nPopovers for .disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.\nWhen triggered from anchors that wrap across multiple lines, popovers will be centered between the anchorsâ€™ overall width. Use .text-nowrap on your <a>s to avoid this behavior.\nPopovers must be hidden before their corresponding elements have been removed from the DOM.\nPopovers can be triggered thanks to an element inside a shadow DOM.\nBy default, this component uses the built-in content sanitizer, which strips out any HTML elements that are not explicitly allowed. See the sanitizer section in our JavaScript documentation for more details.\nThe animation effect of this component is dependent on the prefers-reduced-motion media query. See the reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation.\nKeep reading to see how popovers work with some examples.",
