        "description": "When an alert is dismissed, the element is completely removed from the page structure. If a keyboard user dismisses the alert using the close button, their focus will suddenly be lost and, depending on the browser, reset to the start of the page\/document. For this reason, we recommend including additional JavaScript that listens for the closed.bs.alert event and programmatically sets focus() to the most appropriate location in the page. If youâ€™re planning to move focus to a non-interactive element that normally does not receive focus, make sure to add tabindex=\"-1\" to the element."
