Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no margin by default, so use spacing utilities as needed.\n\nBelow is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so theyâ€™ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various sizing options.",
