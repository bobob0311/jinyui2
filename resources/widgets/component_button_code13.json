        "description": "To cover cases where you have to keep the href attribute on a disabled link, the .disabled class uses pointer-events: none to try to disable the link functionality of <a>s. Note that this CSS property is not yet standardized for HTML, but all modern browsers support it. In addition, even in browsers that do support pointer-events: none, keyboard navigation remains unaffected, meaning that sighted keyboard users and users of assistive technologies will still be able to activate these links. So to be safe, in addition to aria-disabled=\"true\", also include a tabindex=\"-1\" attribute on these links to prevent them from receiving keyboard focus, and use custom JavaScript to disable their functionality altogether.",
