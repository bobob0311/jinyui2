They’re toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.\n\nDropdowns are built on a third party library, Popper, which provides dynamic positioning and viewport detection. Be sure to include popper.min.js before Bootstrap’s JavaScript or use bootstrap.bundle.min.js \/ bootstrap.bundle.js which contains Popper. Popper isn’t used to position dropdowns in navbars though as dynamic positioning isn’t required.",
