        "description": "Scrollspy toggles the .active class on anchor (<a>) elements when the element with the id referenced by the anchor’s href is scrolled into view. Scrollspy is best used in conjunction with a Bootstrap nav component or list group, but it will also work with any anchor elements in the current page. Here’s how it works.\n\nTo start, scrollspy requires two things: a navigation, list group, or a simple set of links, plus a scrollable container. The scrollable container can be the <body> or a custom element with a set height and overflow-y: scroll.\n\nOn the scrollable container, add data-bs-spy=\"scroll\" and data-bs-target=\"#navId\" where navId is the unique id of the associated navigation. If there is no focusable element inside the element, be sure to also include a tabindex=\"0\" to ensure keyboard access.\n\nAs you scroll the “spied” container, an .active class is added and removed from anchor links within the associated navigation. Links must have resolvable id targets, otherwise they’re ignored. For example, a <a href=\"#home\">home<\/a> must correspond to something in the DOM like <div id=\"home\"><\/div>\n\nTarget elements that are not visible will be ignored. See the Non-visible elements section below.",
