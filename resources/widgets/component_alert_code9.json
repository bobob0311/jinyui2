        "description": "Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert inline. Here’s how:\n\n - Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.\n - Add a close button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the close button.\n - On the close button, add the data-bs-dismiss=\"alert\" attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the button element with it for proper behavior across all devices.\n - To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade and .show classes.\nYou can see this in action with a live demo:",
